    <p class="para">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="para2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements</p>
    <p class="para3">There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
